## Definition
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks are used in various applications, including function call management, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.

## Key Characteristics of Stack

LIFO Structure: The most recently added element is the first to be removed. 
## Operations
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove and return the top element of the stack.
Peek/Top: Return the top element without removing it.
isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
isFull: Check if the stack is full (only applicable in fixed-size stacks).
## Implementation
Stacks can be implemented using two main methods: arrays and linked lists.

# Algorithms
## Algorithm for Stack Implementation
### Data Structure
Define a class Stack with:
An array arr of size MAX to store stack elements.
An integer top initialized to -1 to track the top element.
### Operations
Push(value)

If top is equal to MAX - 1, print "Stack overflow! Cannot push."
Otherwise, increment top and assign arr[top] = value.
Print "value pushed to stack."
Pop()

If top is -1, print "Stack underflow! Cannot pop."
Otherwise, print arr[top] and decrement top.
Display()

If top is -1, print "Stack is empty."
Otherwise, print all elements from arr[top] down to arr[0].
### Main Function
Create an instance of Stack.
Repeat the following until the user chooses to exit:
Display a menu with options: Push, Pop, Display, Exit.
Read user choice.
Perform the corresponding operation based on user choice.
